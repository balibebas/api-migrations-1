# API Migrations

This project tracks current desired versions for all tracks used by the default Reaction Platform. You can fork it to get started but you will likely diverge as you add, remove, and change the Reaction API plugins you use.

This repo was created by following [these instructions](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/migrator#usage). If you don't want to fork this, you can build your own data version tracking project using those steps.
